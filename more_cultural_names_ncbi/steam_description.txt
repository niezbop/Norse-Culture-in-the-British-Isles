This is a patch between [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2282070652]Norse Cultures in the British Isles[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2217534250]More Cultural Names[/url].

While both mods are not strictly incompatible, [b]More Cultural Names[/b] if loaded after [b]Norse Cultures in the British Isles[/b] does not support it, and the immersion added by the cultural names is broken by the fact that the [b]Northeod[/b] and [b]Norse-Gaelic[/b] are not covered by the mod.

This patch addresses this issue by:
[list]
[*] Creating Norse-Gaelic names from More Cultural Names Norwegian
[*] Creating Northeod names from More Cultural Names Danish
[*] Adding back the flavour added by Norse Cultures in the British Isles
[/list]

Load this mod after both mods for it to work.
