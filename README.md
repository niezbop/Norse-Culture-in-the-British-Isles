Norse cultures in the British Isles
===================================

# About

__Norse cultures in the British Isles__ is a flavour mod for [Crusader Kings III](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/crusader-kings-iii/CKCK03GSK0000001-MASTER.html) that adds two new __creatable cultures__ in the North Germanic group. These cultures describe an alternate history in which Norse settlement in Northern England and Scotland/Ireland would have intensified, leading to the emergence of Norse cultures in those parts of Britannia influenced by the local people, respectively the Northeod culture and the Norse-Gaelic one.

# In game features

- 2 new cultures, Northeod and Norse-Gaelic
- Decisions and event chains to create these cultures
- Added flavour for the new cultures

## Culture creation requirements

- Capital province in Northern England (or Scotland/Ireland)
- Be part of the North Germanic group
- Directly hold at least one North Germanic county in Northern England (or Scotland/Ireland)
- At least one duchy of note completly controlled
- Culture not already created
- Distinguished [level of fame](https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Resources#Prestige)

## Compatibility

This mod was created with compatibility in mind, but still modifies the following two files:
- `common/culture/cultures/00_north_germanic.txt`
- `common/landed_titles/00_landed_titles.txt`

Any mod that also changes the north germanic culture group (`00_north_germanic.txt`) will break this mod if loaded after it.

Any mod that changes `00_landed_titles.txt` can be loaded after this mod safely, all decisions and the two cultures will exist and work just fine, but a lot of flavour will be missing out (the Duchy of York will be called York for Northeod instead of Jorvik for example).

# Historical plausability

__DISCLAIMER:__ I am not a historian in any way, nor have I any specific qualifications in that field, so any information I give in this section is to be taken with a grain of salt.

## Norse-Gaelic

[Norse had a strong presence in Scotland and Ireland between the 9th to 12th centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse%E2%80%93Gaels) which led to a period where Norse-Gaels were an identified group of people. While they ended up being integrated in what we consider Gaelic, I think that it is fair to assume that they could have developed their own identities, should their number had been bigger.

## Northeod

Similarly to the Norse influence in Gaelic parts of Britannia, the Norse were present in [Northern England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_York) and [Eastern England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danelaw) (which is already partially integrated into the game through the [Restore the Danelaw decision](https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Decisions#Restore_the_Danelaw)). While historically the Norse rulers in Britannia were driven out by the end of the 11th century, I believe that should they had been able to hold the land instead of the Norman, it could have led to the birth of a different people.

The word _Northeod_ itself, is an interpretation of an old germanic word [norðþéod](https://germanic.ge/en/ang/word/nor%C3%BE-%C3%BE%C3%A9od/), meaning "northern people, the northerners". It is in no way whatsoever historically relevant.
